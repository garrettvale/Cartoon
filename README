Final Submission

overView: simple animation of a portal man jumping through the blue portal and re appearing in the
orange portal seemingly teleporting between the two, the man can be sped up or slowed down by the user
using A & D on the keyboard,

Design Choices: the design was straight forward, the Lambda expressions really clean up the design
and the naming conventions are easily readable. had some trouble connecting the composite shape to the
root pane but used an unconventional format to link them.

known bugs : there is a small glitch where the figure appears on the opposite line of movement than it should
only occurs when switching between the back of the pane to the front
